# Basic-Blackjack-Prototype

This simple blackjack project was created as a prototype to resemble a game of blackjack.  
Although during the build of the game, other player's value of hand were not hidden, functionality still worked.  

## Source code included, as well as snapshots of the game in their respective folders.

### About this project:

This is a software project that was created in the past year (~2021) to grasp a greater understanding on how I could use more of the implemented Java Swing library to provide a more interactive user interface. For this project, I created a game of Blackjack for a single person to play, which keeps track of the user's score as well as three other computer player's scores. The user plays along with the three computers in an attempt to get as close to the number 21 without passing 21. For the purpose of this project, all scores are made public to the player. There is a hints bar on the top of the screen that directs the user through how to play the game. The game will calculate who wins at the end, and displays the winner in yellow, and anyone who passes 21 in red.
